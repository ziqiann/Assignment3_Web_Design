                <p>The Museum of Islamic Art was I.M. Pei’s last major building, completed in 2008 just months before his 92nd birthday. In many ways, it was a summary of the driving forces in his full body of work, including respect for history and context, sculptural geometry, and the paramount importance of light. Precisely detailed using materials of the highest quality, it marshaled innovative technologies in the service of architecture and architecture in the service of man. The monumental building is a cross-cultural product of diplomacy, power, and wealth. It typified the kind of large difficult projects Pei came to attract, and the creation of high-profile icons that his clients came to expect.<br>
                </br>Islamic architecture and art have been instrumental in shaping the identity of Arab societies for centuries, reflecting a unique system of beliefs, attitudes, and values. With the increasing focus on preserving local identity, historical buildings are being converted into museums or constructed in neo-vernacular styles in Arab Gulf countries. One such monument is the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar, designed by I.M Pei.<br>
                </br>Despite being outside the principles of Islamic design and local Qatari architecture, the Museum of Islamic Art is one of the most prominent monuments in the city and an emblematic icon of neo-vernacular Qatari architecture. The museum reflects the vitality, complexity, and diversity of the arts of the Islamic world and showcases masterpieces from three continents spanning from the seventh to the nineteenth centuries.</p>

                <i>“There are buildings that inspire awe, that project an image of greatness and permanence, and there are buildings that are exceptional for the way they adapt to their surroundings and enhance the beauty of their environment. The Museum of Islamic Art in Doha is both.”</i><br>
                </br>As one approaches the building, the entire weight of the structure begins to decrease, and the forms become more imposing. The bridge, flanked by rows of tall palm trees, is placed diagonally to the entrance, which makes the stacked geometric shapes appear more angular and the contrast between the light and the most extreme shadow. Soon some traditional details begin to appear: the two small arched windows above the entrance or the covered gallery that links the museum with an educational center. These touches seem minor, but they provide a sense of scale, so that the size of the building can be understood according to the size of the human body.</p>
