                    <p>In 2008, at age 91, I.M. Pei accepted the commission to design a chapel for the Miho Institute of
                        Aesthetics, having already executed Miho’s belltower and Miho Museum. The 5,220-square-foot
                        building was one of Pei’s smallest. Completed in 2012, it was also his last (among many that
                        were supposed to have been). With a certain poetry that Pei himself acknowledged, his career
                        began and ended with a chapel, starting 52 years earlier with Luce Chapel in Taiwan, almost
                        identical in size and similarly distilled from enormous complexity into pure form.<br>
                        </br>The Miho Institute of Aesthetics Chapel is symbolically and architecturally the school’s
                        centerpiece, purposefully elevated atop a sloped incline and, in form, deliberately contrasting
                        with surrounding angular building forms. Inspired by folding a simple square of paper into a
                        cone and the drape of an oriental gown, this deceivingly simple building was realized only
                        through great discipline. Responding to this inspiration, the lighting system was obliged to
                        maintain similar simplicity.<br>
                        </br>It was the biggest project for me to build a dormitory with a floor space of about 25,000
                        m² on the site of 8 hectares in Koka city, Shiga Prefecture. It is a huge project for five years
                        including building design and supervision, such as development permission, permission of the
                        Natural park law, school permission acquisition, etc. The number of designers and constructors,
                        the size of the building, and the quality as a high-end architecture are by no means
                        unprecedented.</p>

                <div class="image2_text">
                    <p>The 240-seat chapel form results from folding a two-dimensional fan-shaped surface into a conical
                        volume, defined geometrically by a lemniscate curve, or a torus sectioned tangent to its inner
                        circle. The lofted surface between the top and bottom curves is fabricated with 51 custom-warped
                        stainless steels panels on the exterior and over 8,454 individually curved Japanese red cedar
                        wood planks on the interior cladding a structural concrete shell. The joints of the wood planks
                        vary in size to control absorption of various sound wavelengths to create an optimal neutral
                        space for congregation and contemplation.<br>
                        </br>There are only three lighting elements in the 5,220 sq. ft. chapel: a circular chandelier
                        overhead, a cove where the walls meet the floor, and a stanchion supporting a line of gimbals
                        lighting the altar. No lighting hardware marks the custom cedar plank walls and there is no
                        ceiling, therefore, all lighting elements had to be unique and appropriate solutions for this
                        elegant and simple building.</p>
