                <p>The commission to design the National Center for Atmospheric Research was Pei’s greatest opportunity as a newly independent architect. It was also his most difficult challenge as all of his work up to that point had been urban (mostly redevelopment), human-scaled, modernist, and rigorously modular for the efficient and economical repetition of like units. Pei had no experience dealing with the vastness of raw nature in the scale-less Rocky Mountains. At age 44, he needed to “rinse his brain” and start anew.<br>
                </br>Studies of cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde and pueblos such as Taos led Pei to a loosely neo–Pueblo Revival structure using colors, textures, and massing borrowed from the setting. A nearby quarry yielded a distinctive reddish aggregate that was mixed with concrete for the walls. When it was bush-hammered, the aggregate fractured so as to give a stony look like that of the surrounding soil and the giant, upended stone slabs known as the Flatirons.<br>
                </br>Pei's design achieves simplicity of form despite a complex, seven-story arrangement of clusters of small offices linked to centralized laboratories and libraries. Exhibits include interactive displays, scale models, and simulations that allow visitors to play with the weather. Views from the spectacular site are exploited with terraces and openings at the corners of each tower cluster. The building is placed on the southeast end of the site to maximize its visibility, and the entrance, amid trees and large boulders, does not scar the topography. Visitors are welcome to tour the exhibits inside and the center's outdoor nature trails.

                <i>“You just cannot compete with the scale of the Rockies. So we tried to make a building that was without the conventional scale you get from recognizable floor heights – as in those monolithic structures that still survive fromt he cliff-dwelling Indians.”</i><br>
                </br>Along with being the motherload of geeky weather information, NCAR is one of the last purely Modernist buildings, a Brutalist design, that marked the end of the supremacy of Modernism as the only acceptable and official “style” of architecture for American corporate and government buildings.

                Unlike the original design,  Pei designed a complex of similarly scaled and proportioned buildings, each providing space for different research groups of the institution and gathered in an intellectual community of shared courtyards.  By breaking the building down into smaller units, NCAR avoided the monumentality and thugishness of many of its Brutalist cousins.  The frankly, and intentionally maze-like design was meant to engender chance encounters between often-isolated researchers.</p>
