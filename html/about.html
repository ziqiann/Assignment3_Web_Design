        <h3>About Ieoh Ming Pei</h3>
        <p>Ieoh Ming Pei (1917-2019), a major figure in 20th-century architecture, a renowned founder of a firm, and the
            "greatest interpreter of International style" (Treccani), emigrated from China to the United States in 1935.
            He received a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (his thesis was awarded a Gold Medal by
            the American Institute of Architects) and became a U.S. citizen in 1954. He later studied under Walter
            Gropius at Harvard.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- extra inroduction section -->
    <span class="introduction">Pei went on to design many famous buildings, including the John F. Kennedy Presidential
        Library and Museum, the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the glass pyramid at
        the Louvre, the Museum of Islamic Art, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pei left his mark on innovative
        buildings around the world with elegant geometric shapes of stone, concrete, glass, and steel, earning him
        countless architectural honors throughout his long and legendary career.</span>

                    <p>Ieoh Ming Pei was born into a prominent family in Guangzhou, China on April 26, 1917. Growing up
                        in a magnificent home in Guangzhou called the "Lion Grove Garden", Pei was exposed to a rich
                        cultural and intellectual environment. His family valued education, and he was sent to study in
                        the United States at the age of 18. However, Pei never forgot his cultural heritage and often
                        visited China throughout his life.</p>

                    <p>In 1948, Pei started working for William Zeckendorf's company, Webb & Knapp. While there, he
                        focused on real estate and commercial design, becoming known as a "housing architect" excluded
                        from mainstream American architecture. Although Pei completed many projects for Webb & Knapp,
                        the quality of his architectural work was often criticized as mediocre and unremarkable. This
                        led him to rethink his future prospects, and he eventually left the company to establish his own
                        firm.</p>

                    <p>From 1958 to 1965, Ieoh Ming Pei worked with his partners Henry N. Cobb and Eason Leonard at
                        their firm, I.M. Pei & Associates. During this time, Pei and his team designed several notable
                        buildings, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, which
                        features a distinctive modernist style with angled walls and roofs that mimic the surrounding
                        mountains. These buildings helped establish Pei's reputation as one of the leading architects of
                        his time, paving the way for his later success with more high-profile projects.</p>

                <div class="timeline_text">
                    <p>Ieoh Ming Pei renamed his firm to I.M. Pei & Partners and completed some of his most iconic and
                        significant works. One of his most well-known designs during this period is the East Building of
                        the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which features a triangular shape and a
                        dramatic, angular design that complements the neoclassical style of the adjacent West Building.
                        Another iconic project from this period is the glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum in Paris,
                        which serves as the museum's main entrance. The pyramid's sleek, modernist design stands in
                        stark contrast to the Louvre's historic architecture, and has become one of the most
                        recognizable landmarks in Paris.
                        Pei's work during this period continued to reflect his modernist aesthetic, characterized by
                        bold geometries, innovative use of materials, and a sensitivity to the context and history of
                        the sites where his buildings were constructed. These projects cemented Pei's reputation as one
                        of the most important architects of the 20th century, and helped to establish a new era of
                        architectural design.</p>

                        architecture independently. And during this period, he received several notable awards and
                        honors. In 1992, he was awarded the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, which is often
                        referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.
                        Pei also received the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2010.
                        Additionally, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in
                        the United States.
                        Ieoh Ming Pei passed away on May 16, 2019 at the age of 102 in New York City.
