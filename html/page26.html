                <p>The Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, known as MUDAM, was the longest project of Pei’s career, stretched out over 17 years due to a rash of problems, mostly political, but including location, building size, budget, access, materials, and sensitive environmental issues related to being in a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Progress occurred in spurts, starting and stopping – sometimes for years. The project was also confounded by its timing, as Pei accepted the commission in 1989, a year before he retired from his firm to concentrate on small buildings of personal interest; for various reasons, Pei did not take the job with him, but continued to work on it as a Pei Cobb Freed & Partners project, while engaged in his new independently designed buildings.<br></br>The architecture of the museum aims to be a dialogue between the natural and historical context of its site. In its orientation, it represents a link between the past with the old Fort Thüngen and the historic city of Luxembourg, the present and the future represented by the European district of Kirchberg. With its neighboring cultural institutions that include the Dräi Eechelen Museum, the  Philharmonic Concert Hall of Christian de Portzamparc  and the Place de l’Europe by Ricardo Bofill, the MUDAM  is an emblematic architectural landmark of the city.<br>

                <p>The architect Ieoh Ming Pei visualized an arrow-shaped museum sheltered between the walls of an old fortress, a museum whose geometry was somehow an extension of it and whose interior allowed the public to move freely while enjoying a pleasant visit.<br></br>The asymmetric V-shape of the building, with angles of 45 degrees, rises above the ruins whose shapes and walls can still be seen in the new building. The contrast with the fortress is even more interesting because the Pei building has very geometric volumes and opted for shapes that are both modern and classic. Its architecture is formalistic, while remaining sober and monumental.<br></br>Although Pei’s design was not oriented to specific works, it is not neutral: just as the shape of the building resulted from the situation in place, the positioning of some of the works of art will result from the situation in the building. Art and architecture are automatically linked to each other. Architecture is not about mastering art, it simply wants to provide a framework.</p>
