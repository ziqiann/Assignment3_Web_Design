                <p>In 1983, French President François Mitterrand commissioned I.M. Pei to modernize and expand the Louvre, one of the world’s greatest art collections and an inviolable national monument at the very heart of French history and culture; no matter the solution nor how sweeping the intervention, the integrity of the near-sacred 800-year-old palace was not to be compromised. The seemingly impossible project, executed over a decade, involved the reorganization of the long J-shaped museum into a compact “U” around a focal courtyard.<br>
                </br>I. M. Pei designed the pyramid in a way where the visitors would enter the pyramid and descend into the spacious lobby and then make their way into the main Louvre buildings.
                Records state that the main pyramid consists of 603 rhombus-shaped glass segments and 70 triangular glass segments and metal poles integrating 95 tons of steel and 105 tons of aluminum. You will find 171 panes on three sides and 160 panes on the fourth side, which has the entrance to the pyramid. The pyramid is about 21.6 meters tall covering a base surface area of 1,000 square meters.
                The glass pyramid, inspired by the Pyramid of Giza, was designed to provide a contemporary spin to the surroundings while acting as a central focal point. However, the modern structure is not supposed to take away from the traditional nature of the museum but rather complement it.<br>
                </br>As the decades have passed and Paris has modernized Pei’s design has become embedded in the Parisian culture. It is regarded with similar significance to that of the Eiffel Tower becoming an icon for the people of Paris, as well as the world. Pei’s design has become synonymous with the image of the Louvre marking it as an inseparable entity from the museum and of Paris.</p>

                <p>The Louvre was the most complex and difficult of all buildings by I.M. Pei, and arguably the greatest. It drew on the cumulative experience of everything he had done before and summoned his full strategic reservoir of design, engineering, and planning, together with his legendary social, cultural, political, and diplomatic skills in a way that vastly expanded the scope of architecture.<br>
                </br>The entirety of the project, known as the Grand Louvre, was executed in two phases over the course of a decade. For the first phase, which gave rise to the pyramid, Pei reorganized the museum around the central courtyard, the Cour Napoléon, transforming it from a parking lot to one of the world’s great public spaces. Long-shuttered passageways through the palace were reopened, reinvigorating the plaza and vaulting it into a position of vital gathering space and a bridge to the city beyond.</p>
