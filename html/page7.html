                <p>Suzhou Museum was one of I.M. Pei’s last major works, it was his fourth and final building in China. Arguably, it was the most important for Pei, as it represented a very personal return to his beginnings, a parting gift to his ancestral home of some 600 years. Working as Design Consultant to his sons at Pei Partnership, 83-year-old Pei pursued his ongoing efforts to distill cultural essence in a way that would define a uniquely Chinese language of modern architecture. Here, immersed in local history and context, he built on the past to create an innovative, uniquely pictorial advance in the age-old tradition of Chinese gardens. Suzhou Museum was not an end for Pei, but an important bridge to the future.<br></br>This museum of Chinese culture is located in the historic quarter of the ancient city of Suzhou. It adjoins the landmarked Zhong Wang Fu, a traditional Chinese mansion complex with courtyards and gardens, and the Garden of the Humble Administrator, a 16th-century garden listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Museum opened to the public in 2006.<br></br>The design of the museum takes its cues from the rich vocabulary of Suzhou’s traditional architecture, with its whitewashed plaster walls, dark grey clay tile roofs and intricate garden architecture. However these basic elements have been reinterpreted and synthesized into a new language and order, one that is contemporary and forward looking and hopefully one that is a possible direction for the future of Chinese modern architecture. </p>

                <p>As with traditional Suzhou architecture, the design of the Art Museum is organized around a series of gardens and courts that mediates between the building and its surrounding environment. The main Museum Garden is a contemporary extension and commentary of the Garden of the Humble Administrator to the north. As visual connections between the two properties are not possible due to the high garden walls, water is used physically and metaphorically as a bridge between the two properties.<br>
                </br>The landscape design of the new Museum Garden and its smaller Gallery and Administrative Gardens is not based on traditional and conventional approaches. Rather, new design directions and themes were sought for each of them, where the essence of traditional landscape design can be distilled and reformulated into potentially new directions for Chinese garden architecture.</p>
